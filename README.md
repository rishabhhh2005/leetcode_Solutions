# LeetCode Daily Practice Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository where I upload **daily LeetCode problem solutions** to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as a consistent log of my journey through DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) using LeetCode. I aim to:

- Practice **daily** and improve consistency
- Track my growth over time
- Build a solid base for **interviews & competitive coding**
- Share solutions with clean and readable code
